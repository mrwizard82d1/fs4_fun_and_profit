// ----- Can't mix ints and floats

// Wrong
1 + 2.0

// Correct
float 1 + 2.0

// Wrong
[ 1..10 ] |> List.average

// Correct (map each int to a flot)
[ 1..10 ] |> List.map float |> List.average

// Correct use `averageBy` with `float`
[ 1..10 ] |> List.averageBy float

// ----- Using the wrong numeric type

// Should be an int and not a float
printfn "hello %i" 1.0

// A possible fix
printfn "hello %i" (int 1.0)

// ----- Passing too many arguments to a function

let add x y = x + y

add 1 2 3

// A similar error occurs passing too many arguments to printf

printfn "hello" 42

printfn "hello %i" 42 43

printfn "hello %i %i" 42 43 44

// ----- Passing two few arguments to a function

// Passing too few arguments results in a partial function application. When you use it later, you will get
// an error because the result, a partial function, is not a simple type.

let reader = new System.IO.StringReader("hello")

// The result, `line`, is wrong, but the compiler doesn't complain.
let line = reader.ReadLine

// The compiler error occurs here. `line` is not a string, the expected type, but is a function of type,
// `unit -> string`.
printfn "The line is %s" line

// .NET functions that take no arguments are particularly prone to this issue. The solution is to supply
// no arguments, (), to the function.

let line = reader.ReadLine()

// No compiler error now.
printfn "The line is %s" line

// ----- Straightforward type mismatch

// The simplest case is that you have the wrong type, or you are using the wrong type in a format string.
printfn "hello %s" 1.0

// ------ Inconsistent return types in branches or matches

// A common mistake: not every branch returns that same type.
let f x =
    if x > 1 then "hello"
    else 42
    
let g x =
    match x with
    | 1 -> "hello"
    | _ -> 42

// The straightforward fix: make each branch return the same type.
let f x =
    if x > 1 then "hello"
    else "42"
    
let g x =
    match x with
    | 1 -> "hello"
    | _ -> "42"
    
// A common gotcha': if an `else` branch is missing, it is assumed to return `unit`.
let f x =
    if x > 1 then "hello"
    
type StringOrInt =
 | S of string
 | I of int  // new union type
let f x =
    if x > 1 then S "hello"
    else I 42
    
// ----- Watch out for type inference effects buried in a function.

// A function may cause an unexpected type inference that ripples throughout your code. For example, in the
// following code, the innocent `print` format string accidentally causes `doSomething` to expect a string.
let doSomething x =
    printfn "x is %s" x
    
// Now invoke doSomething with an int
doSomething 1

// Imagine the invocation occurring many, many lines later. :)

// The fix is to check function signatures (hover over the name of the function). And then drill down through
// the function until you find the "guilty party."
//
// Additionally, use the most generic types possible, and avoid type annotations if possible.

// ----- Have you used a comma instead of a semicolon?

// Define a two-parameter function.
let add x y = x + y

// Invoke it using a single argument, a tuple.
printfn "%i" add(1, 2)

// The solution: don't use a comma!
let add x y = x + y
printfn "%i" (add 1 2)

// Remember, .NET library functions take tuples as arguments. Consequently, invoking these functions looks
// just like a C# call.

// correct
System.String.Compare("a", "b")

// incorrect
System.String.Compare "a" "b"

// ----- Tuples must be the same type to be compared or pattern matched.
let t1 = (0, 1)  // type int * int
let t2 = (0, "hello")  // type int * string

// Type mismatch: expecting the right-hand side to be int * int
t1 = t2

// And the length must be the same.
let t1 = (0, 1)  // type int * int
let t2 = (0, 1, "hello")  // type int * int * stringA

// Type mismatch: tuples of two different lengths cannot be compared
t1 == t2

// The same issue can occur during pattern matching.
let x, y = 1, 2, 3

// And similarly for functions.
let f (x, y) = x + y
let z = (1, "hello")
let result = f z  // type string does not match the type int

// ----- Don't use ! as the "not" operator

let y = true
let z = !y  // wrong

// The fix is to use the "not" keyword instead
let y = true
let z = not y  // correct

// ----- Operator precedence (especially in functions and pipes)

// Function application has the highest precedence compared to other operators, so you get an error
// in the following.
String.length "hello" + "world"  // Type string does not match the type int

(String.length "hello") + "world"  // What's really happening

// The fix is to use parentheses to override precedence.
String.length ("hello" + "world")

// Conversely, the pipe operator is low precedence compared to other operators.
let result = 42 + [1..10] |> List.sum  // The type 'a List does not match the type int

let result = (42 + [1..10]) |> List.sum  // What is really happening

// Again, the fix is to use parentheses to override precedence
let result = 42 + ([1..10] |> List.sum)

// ----- let! error in computation expressions (monads)

// Here's a simple computation expression

}

// (I don't yet understand computation expressions so I simply rely on the explanation in the book.)

// The reason for the error is that the type of the member, `Bind`, is "wrapper * func".
// THe fix is to change the bind function to accept a tuple as its single parameter.

type rightWrapBuilder() =
    member this.Bind (wrapper: Wrapper<'a>, func:'a -> Wrapper<'b>) =

//let f =

// ----- Incomplete structured construct

// Often occurs if you are missing parentheses from a class constructor.

// Can also occur if you forget to put parentheses about an operator

// Additionally, one cannot define a namespace in F# interactive
//namespace Customer
//    // declare a type
//    type Person = { First: string; Last:string }

// ----- This expression should have type 'unit'

// Occurs with expressions that are **not** the last expression in a block. Appears to no longer be an issue.

// What happens if `something` **is** a function?
let something () =

// The interactive window allows the expression, but it also **prints** a warning.

// The solution to the warning is to ignore the intermediate expression.
let something () =
    2 + 2 |> ignore
    "hello"
// I do not understand the squiggles underneath the `let` of the previous expression. :( Everything appears
// fine in the interactive window.

// The same problem occurs if you think your writing C# and use a semicolon to separate multiple statements
// on one line.

// wrong
let result = 2 + 2; "hello"

// fixed

// Another variant of this error occurs when assigning to a property (a mutable value)

// `=` versus `<-`

// ----- Value restriction

// By default, the F# inference mechanism tries to generalize to generic types whenever possible.

// ----- This construct is deprecated.

let rnd3 = new System.Random x      // Error

// ----- The field, constructor, or member X is not defined.

// This error commonly occurs in four situations:
// - The value actually is not defined! (Be sure to check for typos or a case mismatch.)
// - Interfaces
